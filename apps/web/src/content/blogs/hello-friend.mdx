Welcome to my trash talk. This is a test blog to experiment with Nextjs and MDX. Setting up a markdown system with Nextjs has been a pain in the ass. I am currently using **[Velite](https://velite.js.org/)**. **Velite** takes markdown from MDX files with React components and turns it into JSON. This process makes it easier to maintain the markdown blog system.

Before **Velite**, I considered **[ContentLayer](https://contentlayer.dev/)**. **ContentLayer** looked very promising, but it seems like the project has been abandoned. The last commit was on September 23, 2023. There is a [sad post](https://github.com/contentlayerdev/contentlayer/issues/429) about the state of the project. It also throws dependency errors when setting it up with Nextjs, which is why I don't want to use it yet. I guess this is the life of a _[JavaScript developer](/portfolio)_ â€” dealing with abandoned projects.
