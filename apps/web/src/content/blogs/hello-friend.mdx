## Introduction

Hello, there!

My name is Rifat Khan.

I am your friendly neighborhood software developer. I live in Gazipur, a chaotic city in Bangladesh.

I like to develop software and game.

And sometimes, I like to reinvent the wheel.

My strong suit is in the JavaScript ecosystem.

I love JavaScript. It one of the most expressive language out there. I also love TypeScript. A curse that exist in JavaScript landscape.

## My Opinion

I am not very opinionated person. Everybody having opinion about anything is one of the biggest problem of 21st century. It is ok to be agnostic about most things. Especially for the things that do not matter.

The opinions I do express are very important to me. And I want to express them in here.

#### So welcome to my world!
