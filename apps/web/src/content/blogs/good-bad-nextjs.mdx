## Introduction

[Nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) is a popular meta framework for [React](https://react.dev/).

It is one of the most popular and powerful framework.

Framework by nature is very opinionated. Nextjs is also the same. It requires certain structure and convention to implement features.

There are many things Nextjs does well and many it does not. And it being a framework for serverless infrastructure sometimes brings some frustration.

This article is a collection of my thoughts on Nextjs.

## The Good

- Nextjs is a framework for React.
- `file-based` routing
- Server Side Rendering and Static Site Generation
- API Routes handlers and middleware
- Image Optimization, font optimization

## The Bad

- No separation of server-side and client-side code.
- Bad self-hosting support
- No batteries included such as Auth support, ORM support, etc.
