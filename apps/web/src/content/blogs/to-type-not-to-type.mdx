## Introduction

TypeScript is just JavaScript with types and headache. And one thing all programmer love more than types is headache caused by their code.

That is why, I love programming in TypeScript. Why let someone else cause me a problem when I can cause my own?

But one thing about typescript is that either some love it or hate it. Nothing in between.

And both have valid reason.

Let's have a discussion about when you should embrace TypeScript and when you should avoid it like your toxic ex.

## To Type

Type is a good thing, and don't let others say otherwise.

TypeScript is the best for working in a team. In a team, one developer does not work on or have knowledge of the whole codebase. It is easy to learn about different functions and their definitions with TypeScript.

## Not To Type

Setting up typescript is a hard process. To work with typescipt, project needs a `tsconfig.json` file.

There is great way to set and get type suggestion for variables and functions without typescript. [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/).

JSDoc is a documentation tool for JavaScript and TypeScript that uses structured comments to describe functions, parameters, return values, classes, types, and more. And an editor with JSDoc support will show these information when hoveing on a function call, variable or object.

Typescript also has [support](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/jsdoc-supported-types.html) for JSDoc.
