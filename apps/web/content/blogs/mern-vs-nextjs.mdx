# What is MERN stack

MERN stack is a full-stack web architechture. It consists of [MongoDB(M)](https://www.mongodb.com/), [Express(E)](https://expressjs.com/), [React(R)](https://react.dev/), and [Node.js(N)](https://nodejs.org/en).

Express is a web framework for Node.js, used for building web application and API. In MERN stack, Express and Node.js work as a middleware used to handle [HTTP request](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Methods) and perform server side operations (example CRUD operations and authentication).

React is a JavaScript library for building user inteface. To use react, developer has to use a bundler like [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) or [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/). Developers used [Create React App](https://create-react-app.dev/) which uses [Webpack](https://webpack.js.org/). But Webpack is a complex tool with a configuration overhead. It is slow and has notoriously poor developer experience. Vite solves a lot of these problem and has become a popular choice in the last few years. Bundler like Vite takes a complex code base and builds them into a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files with asset optimization (image, fonts, etc). It also perform code splitting and minification. This minified JavaScript fetch data using [Fetch API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API). These data is stored in MongoDB. MongoDB is NoSQL database which store data in a flexible, JSON-like format called BSON.
